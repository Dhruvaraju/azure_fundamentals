Building a application for large enterprises will have few issues while deploying applications, the main concerns are maintaining the servers, provide compute power based on user needs, maintaining security of infrastructure and analyzing the application usage. The best solution available for this is Cloud computing.
## What is cloud computing?
- Providing resources for managing applications, like compute power, storage and pay them based on usage.
- Many companies are providing this ex: amazon, google, microsoft etc.,
- Cloud service providers mainly provide the following:
    - **Compute power** like linux servers or applications
    - **Storage** files like pictures and database.
    - **Networking** like securing applications across platforms.
    - **Analytics** for gathering performance metrics and load related info.
## Compute power:
- While building applications using cloud computing, you can choose, how you want to work with your application, based on the resources you need.
- For example you can build a **virtual machine(VM)** which is a emulation of a computer.
- Each VM will have an operating system and hardware as per your needs.
- We don't have to bother about maintaining them and upgrading them. We can even install additional software you need.
